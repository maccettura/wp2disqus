Convert WP comment XML files to Disqus XML.

## How to use

To run from a command line, install as you would any command line tool and run with the following parameters:

`-i`: The path to the input WP XML file
`-o`: The path you want the output Disqus XML file to save to
`-c`: The Disqus 'ChannelID'

To run from Visual Studio, modify the `launchSettings.json` file and add your own values.
